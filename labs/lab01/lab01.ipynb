    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding work will be developed in an accompanying `lab01.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook will be graded (for graphs and free response questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present you the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for PAs will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `lab01.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",

    "The following questions will help you get comfortable with Pandas. These questions are similar to questions on tables in DSC 10; review the [textbook](https://www.inferentialthinking.com) as necessary. As always for Pandas questions:\n",
    "1. Avoid writing loops through the rows of the dataset to do the problem, and\n",
    "2. Test the output/correctness of your code with the help of the dataset given, but be sure your code will also run on data \"like\" the dataset given (sampling rows using the `.sample` method is useful for this!).\n",

    "**Question 7 (Pandas basics):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the file `movies_by_year.csv` in the `data` directory and understand the dataset by answering the following questions. To do this, create a function `movie_stats` that takes in a dataframe like `movies` and returns a series containing the following statistics:\n",
    "* The number of years covered by the dataset (`num_years`).\n",
    "* The total number of movies made over all years in the dataset (`tot_movies`).\n",
    "* The year with the fewest number of movies made; a tie should return the earliest year (`yr_fewest_movies`).\n",
    "* The average amount of money grossed over all the years in the dataset (`avg_gross`).\n",
    "* The year with the highest gross *per movie* (`highest_per_movie`).\n",
    "* The name of the top movie during the second-lowest (total) grossing year (`second_lowest`).\n",
    "* The average number of movies made the year *after* a Harry Potter movie was the #1 movie (`avg_after_harry`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The index of the output series are given in parenthesis above.\n",

    "*Note*: Your function should work on a dataset of the same format that contains information from other years. You may assume that none of the answers involving ranking returns a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: To make sure your function still runs, in the event that one of the 7 parts throws an exception (e.g. due to a very incorrect answer), use `Try... Except...` structures."
